The following is a quick sample of using Repose to perform queries. These samples reference the domain model discussed on the [SampleCode Sample Code] page. Please see [SampleCode Sample Code] for information on the domain model used in these samples.

The Query interface is still in the design stages. It is possible that the methods to create a Query instance, and how to interact with it, may change drastically in the very near future.

= Examples =

== Get all Bugs ==

{{{
$bugs = $session->createQuery('FROM sample_Bug')->execute();
}}}

== Get all Bugs for a specific Project ==

{{{
$query = $session->query('sample_Bug bug WHERE bug.project.projectId = :projectId');
$bugs = $query->execute(array('projectId' => $projectId));
}}}

== Get all Bugs for a specific Project Manager ==

{{{
$query = $session->query(
    'FROM sample_Bug bug WHERE bug.project.manager.userId = :userId'
);
$bugs = $query->execute(array('userId' => $userId));
}}}

== Get all Projects for Bugs owned by a specific User ==

{{{
$query = $session->query(
    'SELECT bug.project FROM sample_Bug bug WHERE bug.owner.userId = :userId'
);
$projects = $query->execute(array('userId' => $userId));
}}}
