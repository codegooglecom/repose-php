Repose is currently under active development after a year break.


= Details =

Development of Repose started again in March 2010 after a year break. The code is being rebuilt from the ground up to address some of the issues that the previous design had.

The source for Repose now [http://github.com/dflydev/repose-php lives on GitHub]. The old downloads have been deprecated. Several of the Wiki pages are going to be deprecated as well.
