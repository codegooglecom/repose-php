# Overview #

Repose is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for PHP5. It aims to provide a transparent unobtrusive persistence layer to PHP developers.

Users of Repose will spend most of their time interfacing with a Repose [Session](ManualSession.md). A Session is defined by a class [Mapping](ManualMapping.md), a persistence [Engine](ManualEngine.md) and an [Autoloader](ManualAutoloader.md). The task of constructing a Session from the appropriate Mapping, Engine and Autoloader combination may be handled by a [Session Factory](ManualSessionFactory.md).

The easiest way to get started with Repose is to take advantage of an existing Session Factory such as the [Configuration Session Factory](ManualConfigurationSessionFactory.md).
